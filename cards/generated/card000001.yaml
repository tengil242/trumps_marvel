  bio: 'Once a member of the Swamp Men of the Savage Land, a tropical jungle hidden
    away in the frozen wastes of Antarctica, Amphibius was one of several of his people
    who were artificially mutated through technological means by the self-styled mutant
    master of magnetism, Magneto, so as to grant them superhuman powers. On Magneto''s
    behalf, the Mutates subsequently battled Ka-Zar, the Lord of the Savage Land,
    and his allies in the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men.
    After the destruction of Magneto''s machines by the X-Man named Marvel Girl, the
    Mutates returned to their original non-superhuman states.

    However, the Mutates later regained their powers thanks to the effects of the
    technology that changed them, causing them to regain their superhuman abilities
    should they ever lose them. Renaming themselves the Beast Brood, the Mutates proceeded
    to capture scientists in the hop of forcing them to mutate other Savage Land natives
    into superhuman beings. The costumed adventurers known as the Avengers and the
    Norse goddess Sif came searching for the scientists and defeated the Beast Brood,
    delivering them to legal authorities in Chile, the nearest nation to the Savage
    Land.

    The Mutates eventually escaped custody in Chile and returned home to the Savage
    Land.  One of the Mutates, Brainchild, assumed leadership of the group. Under
    Brainchild''s leadership, the Mutates clashed with the winged X-Man named Angel,
    the costumed crimefighter Spider-Man, and Ka-Zar. The trio of heroes were searching
    for Karl Lykos, the human alter ego of the mutant pterosaur known as Sauron. Captured
    by the Mutates, the heroes were freed by Lykos but at a terrible cost, as Lykos
    became Sauron once more.

    The Mutates subsequently came under the leadership of Zaladane, a Savage Land
    priestess who once served the being known as Garokk, the Petrified Man. Zaladane
    subsequently led the Mutates in raids on Antarctic research stations, plundering
    Chilean cities, and kidnapping scientists in an effort to cement her seat of power
    in the Savage Land. Zaladane then dispatched the mutates to kidnap the former
    X-Man named Polaris, who was unknowingly Zaladane''s sister. Zaladane stole her
    mutant ability to manipulate magnetism and the Mutates clashed with the X-Men
    who had come to rescue their missing friend.

    Following Zaladane''s death at the hands of Magneto, the Mutates came under the
    leadership of Sauron and clashed once more with the X-Men who were searching the
    Savage Land for clues as to Magneto''s whereabouts.


    Brainchild subsequently regained his position as leader of the Mutates.  When
    the X-Men were helping a band of Saurids return to the Savage Land, Brainchild
    seized the opportunity to settle an old score with the weather-manipulating X-Man
    named Storm. Brainwashing her, Brainchild sent her and the Mutates into battle
    against the rest of the X-Men, but they were defeated. The X-Man Sage subsequently
    reversed Brainchild''s mental manipulation of Storm, and the Mutates were turned
    over to the leaders of both the Saurids and the Savage Land tribes, who seek for
    all denizens of the jungle to coexist in peace.'
